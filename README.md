# 🏠 Home Resource Manager

A personal project to experiment with **time-based recurrence** in a practical context: managing recurring household tasks.
This README covers only the **frontend application**.

---

## Overview (Non-Technical)

Keeping track of house chores and resources can get messy.
**Home Resource Manager** helps organize them by letting you:

- Create **categories** to group related items (e.g., Cleaning, Kitchen, Bathroom).
- Add **resources** to track (e.g., Soap, Groceries, Tools).
- Define **tasks** that can repeat over time (e.g., "Buy groceries every week").
- Mark tasks as **done**, which updates your dashboard with progress and stats.

It’s a simple way to stay on top of recurring responsibilities and visualize what’s already been taken care of.

## Features

- 📂 **Categories** – Organize resources and tasks into logical groups.

- 📝 **Tasks** – Define recurring tasks with time-based logic.
