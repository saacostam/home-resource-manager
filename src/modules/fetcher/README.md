# Fetcher Module

- This module centralizes API-related logic and definitions shared across the app. API here refers to the foundational layer for network requests and data fetching.
- Ideally, the module provides a consistent interface for:
  - Managing the HTTP client
  - Defining query and mutation keys
  - Standardizing API error handling
