# Form Module

- This module provides utility functions and helpers for managing forms across the app. Form utilities are generic and not tied to specific features or schemas.
  Because of this, they are reusable in different form contexts and components.
- Ideally, the utilities here simplify common tasks such as validation, state handling, and data transformation, serving as lightweight building blocks for consistent form management.
